# Hello there!

Welcome to Hydrogen Simulator

Right now you can build it by using the CMakeLists.txt thingy. I run 
```
cmake -S . -B build <br>
cmake --build build
```
Right now the prject is literally just a CMakeLists file and a sample program from SDL but have fun!

To see what I'm doing check out my blog at [portalgolem.net](https://portalgolem.net)

I will (probably) post updates there and also edit the readme as things go on.
