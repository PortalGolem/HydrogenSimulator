Woo! a new idea and a new goal. My goal is to make a game engine for making text based games, 2d games, and also use bits and pieces for 3D.

I don't want to list many eatures but I want to lay some goals that the engine should be able to do

  compile for Linux and Windows with potential to compile for consoles.

  work well with hyprland and use nvim as the primary code editor and also integrate with blender and asprite easily.

  make things qickly and make it easy to draw from and search through past projects without impacting loading times.

  One button to compile and test for Linux

  works well with git

A simple set of goals I think but I've no real idea how I'll complete them.


As for engine development some of my goals are as follows

  compile in one command/hotkey

  test quickly

  a git hub repo


I think thats good for now I'll come back as I evaluate each goal.

Some personal goals / the purpose of this project
  
  Learn a lot about the structure of a program

  make something that I want to show off

  Learn C programming

  Learn about compiling, metaprogramming, and potentially interperters for scripting
